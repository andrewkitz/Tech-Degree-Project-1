                <p>Both my professional and creative fulfillment are fundamentally based in telling stories through wine, stories that instill as much passion, curiosity, and enthusiasm in my audience as they do in me. I've plyed my craft and developed my wide-ranging skill set and experience in a variety of settings including direct sales, distribution, high-end restaurant, and luxury retail. </p>

                <p>As a Certified Sommelier, I have dedicated much time and effort to understanding the variety and tremendous scope of the wine world. I've used this training to effectively communicate this knowledge to food and wine lovers in some of the country's best restaurants and help them select the ideal wine to complete their dining experience.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column-right">
              <p>I also have extensive experience in the online marketing world, having produced and directed e-commerce marketing programs for two of the west coast's premier luxury wine retailers. From crafting engaging prose to building dynamic email templates from scratch, I've been instrumental in bringing the world's best wines to a broad audience.</p>
