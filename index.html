        <h2>Background</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Friends and family have often called me a renaissance man, but I like to think of myself as a "Jack of all trades, Master of none." I have a broad array of personal interests and professional experiences, but everything centers around wine. For the past 13 years, I've worked in every sector of the wine industry, from restaurant to retail to vineyard.</p>
        <p>I'm also a husband, father, and brother. My family provides more joy and happiness than I could hope to have in three lifetimes, let alone one.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>My main purpose in life is to be the most capable protector and provider I can be for my family. Beyond that, I intend to create a rewarding life of balance between my career and my personal interests, which include: </p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>Photography</li>
          <li>Ice Hockey</li>
          <li>Woodworking</li>
          <li>Aikido</li>
          <li>Backcountry Hiking</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ultimately, I'd like to have a comprehensive set of front-end and back-end design skills to make myself as valuable as I can be to prospective employers and clients.</p>
